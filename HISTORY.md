A Short History of This Project
===============================

xUnit support has been wanted for a long time by MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio users, but it wasn't available until Sergey Khabibullin from Russia implemented an addin
during Google Summer of Code under Xamarin's supervision.

Later this addin project has been accepted by xUnit guys and becomes part of xUnit family at GitHub.

However, the upgrade of xUnit to 2.x broke this addin, and users started to complain.

Lex Li started to review this project in Jan 2016, and then finished his initial experiments in Feb. He took over this project officially on May 23. Zheng Wang and 
Matt Ward contributed important patches to move this project forward. Mikayla Hutchinson from Xamarin also kindly shared her advice to guide the development.

Now this addin works fine with Xamarin Studio 6, MonoDevelop 5/6, and is almost ready for Visual Studio for Mac Preview (7). Community members are welcome to raise 
issues and send patches at GitHub.
